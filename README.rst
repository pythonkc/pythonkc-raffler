Python KC Raffler
=================

Just a really simple script I use to raffle giveaways from the PythonKC meetup.com RSVP list.

You'll need your meetup.com API Key and the event_id you want to pull the RSVP list for.

Example usage:
::
    >>python raffle.py -k '<your_api_key' -e <meetup_event_id>
